Helpers
=======

This directory contains scripts that hold snippets of code to create various SOCS/Scheduler related objects. The scripts are not useful as runnables, but for copying into an ipython session for easy object creation.

Requirements
------------

All of the scripts use code from within the SOCS and Scheduler frameworks, therefore these packages must be available.
